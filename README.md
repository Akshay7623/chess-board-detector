# chess-board-detector
This project uses YOLOv8 object detection to detect chess pieces from a board image and automatically generate the FEN (Forsyth‚ÄìEdwards Notation) representation of the position. It also saves a labeled image with piece names on each square.

This project detects **chess pieces on a board image** using a trained **YOLOv8 model** and generates the corresponding **FEN (Forsyth‚ÄìEdwards Notation)**.  
It also saves a **labeled image** with piece names on each square for better visualization.
